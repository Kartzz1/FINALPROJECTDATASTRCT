**Project:** Pet Care Management System
**Section:** C2A
**Course:** Data Structures

## Grading Breakdown

### 1. Data Structure Completeness & Implementation (50%)

**Score:** 50/50

| Data Structure | Implementation          | Functions                                                   | Notes                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ArrayList      | Custom (no built-in)    | addEnd, addStart, addAt, listAll, search, sort, clear, size | Dynamic resizing implemented     |
| LinkedList     | Custom (singly linked)  | addEnd, addStart, addAt, listAll, search, sort, clear, size | Proper node traversal            |
| Stack          | Custom (array-based)    | push, pop, peek, listAll, clear, size                       | Dynamic resizing implemented     |
| Queue          | Custom (circular array) | enqueue, dequeue, peek, listAll, clear, size                | Circular buffer with resize      |
| Tree (BST)     | Custom (recursive)      | insert, search, inOrder                                     | Proper BST properties maintained |

**Excellent Implementation Notes:**

- All data structures implemented from scratch without Java built-in methods
- Search uses linear/manual traversal (not Java contains/indexOf)
- Sort uses bubble sort for ArrayList and LinkedList (not Arrays.sort)
- All functions display contents after operations
- Application context: Pet Care Management System integrating all structures

### 2. Visualization (30%)

**Score:** 30/30

- Each data structure has a `listAll()` function that displays contents after operations
- Console output shows structure state clearly with indices/positions
- Dashboard provides system summary with sizes of all structures
- Menu-driven interface shows results of each operation

### 3. Short Paper (20%)

**Score:** 20/20

- **File:** Pet Care Management System.txt
- **Content:** Detailed 7-paragraph reflection on project experience
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Challenges faced implementing data structures
  - Learning process and problem-solving approach
  - Help received from uncle for guidance
  - Importance of planning before coding
  - Personal growth and skill development
- **Length:** Appropriate (approximately 1.5-2 pages)

---

## Final Grade: **100/100**

### Summary

Outstanding implementation demonstrating mastery of all required data structures. Custom implementations for all structures without relying on Java built-in methods. Comprehensive visualization through console output. Well-written reflection paper documenting the learning journey.
